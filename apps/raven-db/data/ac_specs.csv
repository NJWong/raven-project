1,antiEnergyDefense,Anti-Energy Defense,Defense rating against energy damage.\n\nThis is the total anti-energy defense value of all frame parts.,
2,antiExplosiveDefense,Anti-Explosive Defense,Defense rating against explosive/incendiary demage.\n\nThis is the total anti-explosive defense value of all frame parts.,
3,antiKineticDefense,Anti-Kinetic Defense,Defense rating against kinetic damage.\n\nThis is the total anti-kinetic defense value of all frame parts.,
4,ap,AP,The durability of the AC.\n\nThis is the total AP value of all frame parts.,
5,armsLoadLimit,Arms Load Limit,"Maximum weight arms can carry without compromising on stable operating performance.\n\nHigher values make it easier to manipulate arm weapons, mitigating dips in target tracking and recoil control caused by overload.",
6,attitudeRecovery,Attitude Recovery,"The ability of the ACS to manage strain.\n\nLighter overall weight increases this value, leading to faster recovery from residual impact.",
7,attitudeStability,Attitude Stability,"The maximum load of the ACS (Attitude Control System) can support.\n\nThis is the total attitude stability value of all frame parts.\n\nThe higher this value, the less likely the AC is to stagger.",
8,boostSpeed,Boost Speed,Maximum speed during boost movement.\n\nHigher boost thrust and lower overall weight of the AC contribute to this value.,
9,currentArmsLoad,Current Arms Load,Weight of both hand weapons as a proportion of the maximum arm load.\n\nExceeding the limit will result in diminished target tracking and recoil control.,
10,currentEnLoad,Current EN Load,EN load as a proportion of EN output.\n\nThe AC cannot sortie if this value exceeds the limit.,
11,currentLoad,Current Load,Total load as a proportion of the maximum load.\n\nThe AC cannot sortie if this value exceeds the limit. (The OS upgrade Weight Control can bypass this restriction.),
12,enCapacity,EN Capacity,Total amount of En available for use.\n\nHigher values enable heavy use of EN-consuming actions.,
13,enOutput,EN Output,"EN output of the AC.\n\nHigher values mean that the generator can support more high-burden parts, with the leftover output improving EN recovery speed.\n\nImproved by generators with a higher EN output spec and cores with a higher Generator Output Adjustment spec.",
14,enRechargeDelay,EN Recharge Delay,"Duration of the delay before EN is recharged.\n\nThe lower the value, the more quickly EN recovers after an EN-consuming action.\n\nImproved by generators with a higher EN Recharge spec and cores with a higher Generator Supply Adjustment spec.",
15,enSupplyEfficiency,EN Supply Efficiency,"Rate at which EN is supplied to the AC.\n\nHigher values enable faster EN recovery.\n\nImproved by the EN Output spec of the generator and influenced by the total EN load of the AC, with lighter assemblies recovering EN more quickly.",
16,loadLimit,Load Limit,"Maximum weight legs can support.\n\nHigher values improve capacity, enabling installation of multiple heavy parts.",
17,qbEnConsumption,QB EN Consumption,Amount of EN consumed when using Quick Boost.\n\nEN consumption is reduced when using boosters with a lower Quick Boost EN consumption spec and cores with a higher Booster Efficiency Adjustment spec.,
18,qbReloadTime,QB Reload Time,"Reload time of Quick Boost.\n\nLower values enable agile, consecutive Quick Boost usage.\n\nReload time is compromised if the overall weight of the AC exceeds the booster's QB Reload Ideal Weight spec.",
19,qbSpeed,QB Speed,Initial speed of Quick Boost.\n\nHigher Quick Boost thrust and lower overall weight of the AC contribute to this value.,
20,targetTracking,Target Tracking,"Target tracking performance during lock-on.\n\nThe higher this value, the more likely you are to land shots on moving enemies.\n\nThe Firearm Specialization spec of arm parts contributes to this value.",
21,totalArmsLoad,Total Arms Load,Arm load weight.\n\nCalculated as the sum of the weight of the individual weapons on both arms.,
22,totalEnLoad,Total EN Load,EN load of the AC.\n\nCalculated as the sum of the EN load of all parts.\n\nThe AC cannot sortie if this value exceeds the generator's EN output.,
23,totalLoad,Total Load,"Body load weight.\n\nCalculated as the total weight of all parts, excluding the leg unit.",
24,totalWeight,Total Weight,Total weight of all AC parts.\n\nCalculated as the sum of all weight of individual parts.\n\nInfluences movement speed of the AC.,
