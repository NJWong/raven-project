# Welcome to Raven API

The RESTful API for **Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon**. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Raven API is a public, read-only resource built for developers to access data from Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon.

It contains all the statistics for weapons, frame parts, and other equipment in the game.

## Motivation

The most important aspect of any Armored Core game is the ability to customize your AC. I couldn't find a single source of truth for all the parts and weapons in the game, so I decided to build one.

My goal is to provide a resource that empowers other developers to build tools and services for the AC community.

## Getting started

<div className="not-prose mb-16 mt-6 flex gap-3">
  <Button href="/quickstart" arrow="right" children="Quickstart" />
